## 📝 Program Description

The `AddTwoNumbers` program is designed to perform the following tasks:

- Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
- Read the user's input using the `Scanner` class.
- Calculate the sum of the two input numbers.
- Display the result, including the original numbers and their sum.

## 🔧 Functionality

The program's functionality can be broken down into several key steps:

1. **User Input**: The program uses the `Scanner` class to obtain user input for two numbers. It displays prompts to guide the user in entering the first and second numbers.

2. **Data Processing**: It reads and stores the user's input in the variables `num1` and `num2`. It then calculates the sum of these two numbers and stores the result in the variable `result`.

3. **Output**: The program displays the sum of the two numbers along with a message indicating what the calculation represents. This information is printed to the console.

4. **Resource Cleanup**: Finally, the program closes the `Scanner` object to release system resources.

## 🚀 Usage

To use the `AddTwoNumbers` program, follow these steps:

1. Compile the Java source code (Save it in a file with a ".java" extension) using the following command:
   `javac AddTwoNumbers.java`

2. Run the compiled program with the following command:
   `java AddTwoNumbers`

3. The program will prompt you to enter the first number. Type a numeric value and press Enter.

4. Next, the program will prompt you to enter the second number. Type another numeric value and press Enter.

5. The program will then calculate the sum of the two numbers and display the result on the console.

6. The program will automatically close, releasing any resources it used.

Example of program execution:

``Enter the first number: 10.5``

``Enter the second number: 5.2``

`The sum of 10.5 and 5.2 is: 15.7`
